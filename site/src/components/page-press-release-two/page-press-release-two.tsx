                    September 25, 2020 — Today, Power the Polls — a
                    first-of-its-kind, nonpartisan initiative to recruit a new
                    wave of poll workers, especially among younger, more diverse
                    populations that have not been historically represented in
                    these roles — announced it has recruited more than 500,000
                    potential poll workers since its launch in June 2020,
                    passing a major milestone in their recruitment efforts ahead
                    of the upcoming election. With early voting beginning in
                    many states across the country and poll worker shortages
                    persisting across the U.S., Power the Polls is doubling down
                    on recruiting thousands more poll workers and continuing its
                    work to ensure every polling place across the U.S. is fully
                    staffed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In past elections, more than half of poll workers were over
                    the age of 60. This year, fewer are signing up for the job
                    due to COVID-related health concerns. The consequences of
                    the poll worker shortage have been felt in recent primaries
                    where a lack of poll workers led to long lines and the
                    closure of polling places. Washington, D.C. lost 1,700
                    election workers during its primary in early June.
                    Similarly, Kentucky consolidated in-person voting in each
                    county to a single polling place during the primary due to
                    poll worker recruitment concerns.

                    “Reaching 500,000 poll worker recruits so quickly shows how
                    people across the country are stepping up to protect our
                    democracy and our vulnerable communities,” said Scott
                    Duncombe, Co-Director of Power the Polls. “We’re so proud of
                    the diverse coalition of support that this effort has
                    inspired to help ensure the upcoming election is safe, fair,
                    and accessible for all. Now, with early voting upon us and
                    November around the corner, this work could not be more
                    urgent. Power the Polls won’t stop until all polling sites
                    are open, staffed, efficient, and functioning.”

                    “Signing up to be a poll worker is one of the best ways to
                    make sure our democracy is strong and that everyone’s voice
                    is heard, especially during this unprecedented pandemic,”
                    said Robert Brandon, President of Fair Elections Center.
                    “After several years of our organization advocating for and
                    working toward a more diverse pool of poll workers, it’s
                    great to see the large numbers of people signing up to work
                    the polls, many for the first time.”

                <p>
                    “We only have a few weeks left to sign up enough poll
                    workers to ensure a safe, fair, and accessible election for
                    all,” said Erika Soto Lamb, Vice President of Social Impact
                    Strategy, Comedy Central and MTV. “Not enough poll workers
                    means not enough polling locations and long lines that makes
                    voting difficult or impossible for a lot of people. We must
                    continue to address voter access issues, particularly for
                    low-income voters, voters from marginalized communities of
                    color, voters with disabilities and voters in need of
                    language assistance.”

                    "Civic Alliance member companies are proud to be part of
                    this momentous achievement," said Mike Ward, Co-Founder of
                    the Civic Alliance and VP of Voter Engagement at Democracy
                    Works. "500,000 people signing up to work the polls is an
                    important milestone to celebrate. But our work is not done.
                    With more than 120 of America's leading companies
                    encouraging their employees and consumers to serve this
                    year, we will continue to make major strides in addressing
                    this urgent need."

                    “We’re excited about this new, expanded initiative to
                    recruit people to be poll workers for the Fall elections,”
                    said Fair Elections Center President Robert Brandon. “We
                    established Work Elections to provide information and make
                    it easy for folks to sign up. This year, with the pandemic
                    affecting the ability of many people who normally work at
                    the polls, we’re pleased to join with these partners to get
                    the word out that poll workers are going to be desperately
                    needed in many communities to help ensure a safe and fair
                    election for voters.” Power the Polls recruits and supports
