                    <b>January 30, 2024 -</b> Power the Polls, the first-of-its-kind,
                    nonpartisan initiative for recruiting the next generation of
                    poll workers to help ensure safe, fair, and secure
                    elections, today released a new Bilingual Poll Worker
                    Recruitment Toolkit. The toolkit, released on Help America
                    Vote Day 2024, represents the organization’s first batch of
                    in-language resources to support partners and election
                    administrators in recruiting bilingual poll workers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “At Power the Polls, we are focused on recruiting the next
                    generation of poll workers, including those who have the
                    tech fluency and language skills that election
                    administrators most need. This new in-language poll worker
                    recruitment toolkit furthers our commitment to recruiting
                    bilingual poll workers who can help their neighbors vote,”
                    said Marta Hanson, National Program Manager for Power the
                    Polls. “With this toolkit, election administrators and
                    community organizations can more directly engage with and
                    recruit bilingual speakers and help make elections more
                    accessible for every voter.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The toolkit provides social media copy and graphics in 11
                    languages focused on the need for poll workers for this
                    year’s elections and how to sign up. Languages featured in
                    the initial toolkit include: Arabic, Chinese (Simplified),
                    Hindi, Hmong, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Punjabi, Spanish,
                    Tagalog and Vietnamese, with more to be added ahead of the
                    November 2024 elections. Of all the requests from election
                    administrators for bilingual poll workers during the 2022
                    cycle, these languages were the most often requested. All
                    toolkit graphics also include in-language alt text for
                    screen readers to help further enhance their accessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The release of the toolkit reflects the increasing demand
                    for bilingual poll workers to serve diverse communities of
                    voters nationwide. Over the last three decades, the number
                    of people in the U.S. who speak a language other than
                    English at home has tripled, from 23.5 million (about 1 in
                    10) to 67.8 million (about 1 in 5), per ShareAmerica and the
                    U.S. Census Bureau. In response to requests from election
                    administrators in jurisdictions across the country, Power
                    the Polls recruited bilingual poll workers speaking over 25
                    languages in 2022 — and the organization has over 50
                    languages represented in its database of potential poll
                    workers.
