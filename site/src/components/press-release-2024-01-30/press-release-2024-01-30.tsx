                    <br />
                    Power the Polls is a first-of-its-kind, nonpartisan
                    initiative to recruit the next generation of poll workers to
                    ensure safe and fair elections for all voters. Launched in
                    June 2020 by a coalition of businesses and nonprofits, Power
                    the Polls recruited over 700,000 prospective poll workers
                    across the United States during the 2020 elections and an
                    additional 275,000 poll workers in 2022. Power the Polls
                    directly recruits poll workers, coordinates with election
                    administrators to identify and meet poll worker needs in
                    local communities, and houses a centralized hub for local
                    poll worker information. For more on Power the Polls, visit

                    <br />
                    Help America Vote Day is a day of action established by the
                    U.S. Election Assistance Commission to encourage people
                    across the U.S. to get involved in the electoral process by
                    signing up to be a poll worker and an opportunity to share
                    information on how to register and cast a ballot. By
                    encouraging more people to become poll workers in their
                    communities, Help America Vote Day is addressing the
                    critical shortage of poll workers, strengthening our
                    republic, inspiring greater civic engagement and
                    volunteerism, and helping to ensure election offices have
                    the staff they need throughout 2024.
