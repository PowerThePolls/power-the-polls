               cultural, political, veteran, and advocacy leaders, will
               encourage more people to become poll workers, one of the most

               and securely,” said <strong>Washington</strong>. “By recruiting
               poll workers who are excited to serve their communities, Power
               the Polls has proven its ability to preserve trust in our
               electoral system, especially when democracy is under threat. It
               is an honor to serve as co-chair of the effort to support their

               “At a time when our democracy is facing unique and historic
               threats, the role poll workers play in keeping our elections free
               and fair has never been more important,” said{" "}
               <strong>Kinzinger</strong>. “That’s why Power the Polls’ work is
               so important and why I’m proud to serve as the Advisory Council’s
               Co-Chair. I encourage all Americans to sign up to be poll workers
               through Power the Polls as a great way to serve our communities.”

               “By recruiting potential poll workers, supporting election
               administrators, and housing a centralized hub for localized poll
               worker information, Power the Polls is filling in the gap between
               informed citizens who want to engage in civic life and the
               election officials who need their help,” said Power the Polls
               National Program Manager Marta Hanson. “I am tremendously excited
               to be able to partner with these important voices from across the
               political spectrum to recruit poll workers and ensure a safe,
               secure, and accessible election this fall.”
            </p>
            <p>
               In 2020, amidst a nationwide shortage of poll workers, Power the
               Polls and its partners mobilized and recruited more than 700,000
               potential poll workers in less than 100 days. Power the Polls
               formally relaunched in May 2022 to support poll worker
               recruitment, and in less than six months engaged more than
               275,000 potential poll workers speaking more than 25 different
               languages, to help quickly fill any poll worker shortages. In
               2024, Power the Polls has already tripled the number of
               jurisdictions that it is for monitoring poll worker needs (as
               compared to 2022) and anticipates that number continuing to grow
               as interest in this year’s presidential election increases.
