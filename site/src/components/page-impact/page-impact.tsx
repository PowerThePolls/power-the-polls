                     workers in 2020 and over 275,000 potential poll workers
                     in 2022.

                    In November 2022, Power the Polls partnered with Patinkin
                     Research Strategies to conduct a post-election survey to
                     assess the impact of our work. <strong>The biggest takeaway: Power
                     the Polls successfully recruited and placed poll workers who
                     showed up where they were needed, felt prepared to serve their
                     communities, and had a positive experience working the polls.

                    Election administrators did an effective job training poll
                     workers. Almost every poll worker who received training
                     reported feeling prepared for Election Day.

                    Over half of employed survey respondents reported that

                     polls. Most of these workers were employed by businesses
                     (41%), outpacing government (14%) and nonprofits (12%).
