                <h1>Power the Polls Announces Recruitment of 265,000 Potential Poll Workers
 Ahead of 2022 Election
</h1>
                <p>
                    November 3, 2022 — Just five days before Election Day, Power the Polls – the first-of-its-kind, nonpartisan initiative for recruiting the next generation of poll workers who will help ensure a safe, fair, and secure election – announced it has recruited more than 265,000 potential poll workers since it re-launched in May 2022.

                    "We’re thrilled to have helped connect 265,000 potential poll workers with election offices across the country to ensure every person who wants to vote can do so,” said Jane Slusser, Program Manager at Power the Polls. "With early voting already underway and Election Day mere days away, we’re so inspired by the number of people who have stepped up to do their civic duty and work the polls. Poll workers are essential – as people head to cast their ballots this election, we urge every voter to thank their poll workers and election officials who keep our democracy running.”

                    Since May, Power the Polls has been in touch with over 500 jurisdictions across 42 states to help address reported recruitment challenges. Power the Polls has worked closely with over 400 nonprofit organizations and businesses to recruit younger, more diverse, and non-partisan potential poll workers to ensure that local elections officials' needs for poll workers are identified and met, particularly in these jurisdictions with high need. Just days away from Election Day, nearly all of these jurisdictions have met their recruitment goals, and Power the Polls continues to assist any jurisdictions with last-minute shortages.

                    “It’s incredible to see a new generation of poll workers step up and do their part to maintain the health of our democracy,” said Erika Soto Lamb, Vice President of Social Impact Strategy at MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks. “In 2020, we helped Power the Polls deliver on its mission to recruit the next wave of younger, more diverse poll workers – in fact, Trevor Noah’s calls to action on The Daily Show helped sign up more than 100,000 people ahead of that unprecedented pandemic election. For this election and elections to come, we’ll continue to address voter access issues, particularly for low-income voters, voters from marginalized communities of color, voters with disabilities, and voters in need of language assistance.”

                    “Right now, elections officials are operating polling sites and helping voters cast their ballots across the U.S. Our goal is make sure they have the support they need through Election Day,” said Robert Brandon, President and CEO of the Fair Elections Center. “At the Fair Elections Center, we’ve worked for years on building a better system for recruiting a new generation of diverse poll workers – and we’re thrilled to see that system working so well in 2022.”

                    “Poll workers power our elections – it’s been great to see member companies of the Civic Alliance once again step up to leverage their communities to support participation in our democracy,” said Natalie Tran, Co-Founder of the Civic Alliance and Executive Director of the CAA Foundation. “As trusted brands and employers, companies have a tremendous power to shape our culture. We’re glad to be working with Power the Polls and our corporate partners to use that power for good as we approach Election Day.”

                    “Power the Polls has unquestionably demonstrated the scale of impact that is possible when nonprofits, corporations, and government officials work in deep collaboration,” said Ashley Spillane, co-founder of the Civic Responsibility Project. “With early voting underway across the U.S., Power the Polls and its partners will continue to help ensure every polling place is staffed from now until polls close next week – and for elections to come.”

                    In 2020, Power the Polls and its founding partners – Civic Alliance, Civic Responsibility Project, Comedy Central, Fair Elections Center, Pizza to the Polls, MTV Entertainment Group, and Center for Secure & Modern Elections – recruited more than 700,000 potential poll workers over the course of that election cycle, who ultimately helped ensure the 2020 election ran smoothly despite concerns of mass poll worker shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
