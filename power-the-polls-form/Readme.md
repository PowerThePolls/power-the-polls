## America needs poll workers to power our democracy
Power the Polls is working every day to recruit a new generation of poll workers — folks excited to serve their communities, help their neighbors vote, and ensure safe access to the ballot box for years to come.

**You can help** make sure we have a safe, fair, efficient election for all voters, and potentially get paid to do it!

## How to embed the form

### How to embed in HTML

Include the latest version of the scripts (use module and non-module to support down to IE11) and then use the `<power-the-polls-form>` element like any other HTML element:

```html
<html>

<head>
   <script type="module"
      src="https://unpkg.com/@ptp-us/power-the-polls-form/power-the-polls-form/power-the-polls-form.esm.js"></script>
   <script nomodule
      src="https://unpkg.com/@ptp-us/power-the-polls-form/power-the-polls-form/power-the-polls-form.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
   <power-the-polls-form partner-id="your-ptp-partner-id" />
</body>

</html>
```

### How to embed in React

Add to your project:

```shell
npm install @ptp-us/power-the-polls-form
```

In your `index.jsx`, add the following code to initialize the form element:

```js
import { applyPolyfills, defineCustomElements } from "@ptp-us/power-the-polls-form/loader";

applyPolyfills().then(() => {
   defineCustomElements();
});

// ReactDOM.render( ... )
```

Include the form in your component:

```jsx
import "@ptp-us/power-the-polls-form";

// ...

<power-the-polls-form
   partner-id={partnerId}
   custom-form-field-label={customFieldLabel}
/>
```

> Note: in our testing with React, attribute names must be `kebab-case` and not `camelCase`
>
> To test in your environment, set `customFormFieldLabel` to a non-null value and if it doesn't show up in the form, you need to use `kebab-case`.

## How to customize the form

### How to customize: Attributes

#### partner-id

This will allow us to track the source of signups back to you.

```html
<power-the-polls-form
   partner-id="your-ptp-partner-id"
/>
```

#### custom-form-field-label

*Optional* label for an additional `<input type="text">` field on the form. If `null`, no additional field will be displayed.

```html
<power-the-polls-form
   custom-form-field-label="Union name"
/>
```

### How to customize: Styles

The form does add some basic styling, but you can override with your own CSS. The elements in use are:
`<form>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<p>`, `<button>`, and `<a>` as well as three relevant classes: `a.poll-worker-action`, `a.poll-worker-action.cta`, and `a.jurisdiction`.

Also of note, `button` and `a.poll-worker-action.cta` are styled the same and both set a `background-color`.

You can use the `power-the-polls-form` element in CSS, e.g.:

```css
power-the-polls-form button {
  background-color: #f0f;
  color: #fff;
}

power-the-polls-form a.poll-worker-action.cta {
  background-color: #f0f;
  color: #fff;
}
```

### How to customize: Events

You can listen for a `submitCompleted` or `submitError` event if desired in order to provide additional feedback to your users.

```javascript
const form = document.querySelector("power-the-polls-form");

form.addEventListener("submitCompleted", () => {
   console.log("Power the Polls form has been submitted");
});

form.addEventListener("submitError", () => {
   console.log("Power the Polls form has encountered an error")
});
```
